    * https://www.plasticfilmrecycling.org/recycling-bags-and-wraps/plastic-film-education-individuals/learn-whats-recyclable/
    * Do not include:
        * Degradable/compostable bags or film packaging
        * Pre-washed salad mix bags
        * Frozen food bags
        * Candy bar wrappers
        * Chip bags
        * Six-pack rings

2. Frozen Food packaging
    * How to recycle:
    * Watch Out for Wax Lining. Frozen food boxes look like paper or cardboard but are actually lined with wax or a plastic polymer. This can help preserve and insulate foods, but it makes these packages impossible to recycle.

3. Plastic caps // Caps that aren’t replaced onto bottles
    Most caps CAN be recycled, but not when they’re separated from the bottle. Caps can slip off conveyer belts during the recycling process, so when you empty a bottle, crush it, cap it, and toss it in the recycling bin. How2Recycle almost always encourages consumers to replace small caps and lids before recycling. If a How2Recycle label says to Discard Cap,it means there’s something about the cap that renders it non-recyclable and should be put in the trash before you recycle the rest of the container.



4.Toothbrushes
    Toothbrushes are difficult the recycle due to nylon bristles, metal staples that hold the bristles in place, and the plastic handles. These materials need to be separated before they can be processed.

5. Plastic Pumps

    Just because most of a package appears to be recyclable, that doesn’t necessarily mean that all parts of the packaging are recycled. Metal springs are commonly, but not always, found in pumps and sprayers. Unfortunately, metal is detrimental to the plastic recycling stream. For this reason, look for the How2Recycle label to tell you whether you should discard the closure before recycling.

6. Plastic Bags
    Plastic bags and items made from their plastic material (i.e. shrink wrap, bubble wrap, Ziploc bags, newspaper bags, trash bags, etc.) are the worst recycling contaminator of all. Many local retailers have recycling programs for plastic bags and films.

    Keep them out of the bin to save the sorters at your local recycling facility a huge amount of extra removal work while also saving their machines the hassle of getting clogged.

The Wrong Plastics
    Some recycling program might accept plastics #1-7 but the final rejection is decided at the sorting facility. Rejection of plastics usually comes down to the type of the plastic being recycled and what it once contained. Food containers are usually okay.

7. The Different Types of Plastics (earth 911)
//This could be it's own card that spans the length of the page. 
    Containers that once held non-food items should be checked to determine the type of plastic it’s considered.

    For instance, the most commonly recycled plastics are #1 – PET and #2 HDPE. Plastics #3 through #7 are sometimes recyclable.

    To see if your item is one of the above mentioned locate the chasing arrows symbol.  If you see a #1, #2, or #3 through #7 you should be good to recycle, just make sure that the item is completely empty or rinsed with the tops and lids on.

    This is another time where checking with your specific municipal recycling program’s manager would be greatly beneficial.

What do the numbers on recycling mean?

    Recyclable plastic usually comes with a little recycling symbol printed on the bottom and depending on the product, there might be a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 stamped in the center of the symbol. It’s easy to miss, but this tiny digit is actually pretty important, because it’s an ID.

    The number is a resin identification code, used to help recycling plants sort materials. Recyclable plastics are labeled with numbers 1-7 to tell workers what kind of plastic it is, and how it should be processed. But it also helps recycling collectors determine what items they can accept — and which ones go in the trash.

    * What are the important rules to ensure that I’m “recycling right”? The most important rule is CLEAN AND DRY! Make sure there is no water, other liquid residue, or food in your bags and wraps when you recycle them. Separate the cardboard from beverage overwraps and put the cardboard in your curbside bin. Also don’t put any plastic containers in the store bins – only bags and films. Printing is OK, but large paper labels should be removed.
